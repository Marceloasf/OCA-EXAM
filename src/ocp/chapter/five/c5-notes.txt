* As mentioned on c1-notes and c2-notes, I am starting this book at this chapter (5) because the OCA-8 book already
  covers the same subjects of the Chapters 1-4 from this book in its Chapters 1-2, they will be revisited futurely.

** Chapter 5 - Core Java APIs

* Working with Java Primitive Data Types and String APIs
- Create and manipulate Strings.
- Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods.

** String immutability:
    - Once a String object is created, it is not allowed to change. It cannot be made larger or smaller, and you
    cannot change one of the characters inside it. You can make a reference point to a different String object.
    Obs.: Immutable classes in Java are final, which prevents subclasses creation.
