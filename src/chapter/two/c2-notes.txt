** Chapter 2 - Operators and Statements

* Using Operators and Decision Constructs
- Use Java operators; including parentheses to override operator precedence;
- Create if, if/else and ternary constructs;
- Use a switch statement;

* Using Loop Constructs
- Create and use while loops;
- Create and use for loops, including the enchanced for loop;
- Create and use do/while loops;
- Compare loop constructs;
- Use break and continue;

** Operators
 - Three types of operators are available in Java: unary (++, --), binary(+, -, *, /, %) and ternary(a ? b : c);
 - Unless overridden with parentheses, Java operators follow order of operation;
 - If two operators have the same level of precedence, then Java guarantees left-to-right evaluation; 
 - All of the arithmetic operators may be applied to any Java primitives, except boolean;
 - To String values, only the addition operators + and += may be applied, which results in String concatenation;
 - Modulus operation (%) may also be applied to negative integers and floating-point integers;
** Order of operator precedence (decreasing order of precedence):
 - Post-unary operators - expression++, expression--
 - Pre-unary operators - ++expression, --expression
 - Other unary operators - ~, + (positive), - (negative/negates a expression), ! (inverts a boolean's logical value)
 - Multiplication/Division/Modulus - *, /, %
 - Addition/Subtraction - +,-
 - Shift operators - <<, >>, >>>
 - Relational operators - <, >, <=, >=, instanceof
 - Equal to/not equal to - ==, !=
 - Logical operators - &, ^, | - (Evaluates all conditions) 
 - Short-circuit logical operators - &&, || (Short circuit on the first true)
 - Ternary operators - boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2
 - Assignment operators - =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=

** Numeric promotion rules:
 - If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values 
 to the larger of the two data types (ex.: short -> int or long);
 - If one of the values is integral and other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote 
 the integral value to the floating-point value's data type;
 - Smaller data types, namely byte, short and char, are first promoted to int any time they're 
 used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int;
 - After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value 
 will have the same data type as its promoted operands;

** p.59
** Increment and Decrement Operators:
  There are two orders that can be applied when using these operators:
 PRE (++x or --x) and POST (x++ or x--);
 Examples of the distinction (code snippet):
 `int counter = 0;`
 `System.out.print(counter); // Outputs 0`
 `System.out.print(++counter); // Outputs 1`
 `System.out.print(counter); // Outputs 1`
 `System.out.print(counter--); // Outputs 1`
 `System.out.print(counter); // Outputs 0`
**
 `int x = 3;`
 `int y = ++x * 5 / x-- + --x;`
 `System.out.println("x is " + x);`
 `System.out.println("y is " + y);`
 
 Simplify this:
 `int y = 4 * 5 / x-- + --x; // x assigned value of 4`
 then
 `int y = 4 * 5 / 4 + --x; // x assigned value of 3`
 then
 `int y = 4 * 5 / 4 + 2; // x assigned value of 2`
 then the result is `x is 2` and `y is 7`

** p.61
** Overflow and Underflow:
  Overflow is when a number is so large that it will no longer fit within the data type,
 so the system "wraps around" to the next lowest value and counts up from there. There is 
 a analogous Underflow, when the number is too low to fit in the data type. For example:
 - `System.out.print(2147483647+1); // -2147483648`
 Since 2147483647 is the maximum int value, adding any strictly positive value to it will 
 cause it to wrap to the next negative number.

** p.63
** Relational Operators:
  The instanceof operator is the fifth relational operator, and it's applied to object references and classes or interfaces.
 - `a instanceof b` - True if the reference that a points to is an instance of a class,
 subclass or class that implements a particular interface, as named in b.

** p.65
** Equality Operators:
   The equality operators (= and !=) are used in one of three scenarios:
  1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the numeric values are of
  different data types, the values are automatically promoted as previously
  described. For example, 5 == 5.00 returns true since the left side is
  promoted to a double.
  2. Comparing two boolean values.
  3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values.
  - For object comparison, the equality operator is applied to the references to the objects, not the objects they point to;
  - Two references are equal if and only they point to the same object or both point to null.
